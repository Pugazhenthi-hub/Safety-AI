**Phase 1: Project Overview, Objective, and Problem Statement**

**üß† AI-Based Community Safety System.**

**üß© 1. Project Overview:**

The AI-Based Community Safety System is designed to enhance public safety by using artificial-intelligence-driven video surveillance.
It analyzes live camera feeds to automatically detect violent behavior, suspicious activities, or emergencies, and immediately alerts authorities or community members.
The system reduces manual monitoring, reacts faster to incidents, and can operate 24/7 in public or private areas such as streets, schools, or residential zones.


**üéØ 2. Project Objectives:**

**\*** To detect violent or abnormal activities in real time using AI.
**\*** To generate automatic alerts (sound, message, or email) when a threat is detected.
**\*** To improve response time of community security personnel.
**\*** To minimize human error in surveillance and monitoring tasks.
**\*** To build a scalable and low-cost system deployable on existing CCTV networks.


**‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Problem Statement:**

Community safety largely depends on human operators watching surveillance footage, which is inefficient and error-prone.
When multiple cameras stream simultaneously, security staff often miss critical incidents such as fights, vandalism, or assaults.
Manual systems also delay emergency responses, leading to greater damage or danger.
Hence, there is a need for an automated, AI-powered safety system that can continuously monitor video feeds, detect violence or suspicious activity, and send instant alerts to the concerned authorities.

### Phase 2: Data and Model:
  ## 1. Dataset Options:
            Hockey Fight Dataset
            ViolenceNet Dataset

  ## 2. Movies Fight Dataset:
            (These datasets contain violent vs non-violent video clips.)

  ## 3. Model Approach:
            Use a pre-trained CNN + LSTM model (or MobileNet + LSTM)
            Later, you can integrate a violence_model.pth
