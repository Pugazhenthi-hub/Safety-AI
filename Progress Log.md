## Current Project Status Update:
We have completed the data preparation stage of the project.
Collected and organized violence and normal activity videos (including abuse, fire, explosion, anomaly activity, and normal videos).
Extracted video frames and grouped them by class inside the frames_by_class folder.
Set up the environment with OpenCV, NumPy, PyTorch, and other necessary Python libraries.
Designed the plan for the CNN+LSTM model architecture, which will process spatial (CNN) and temporal (LSTM) features.
The next step is to train and evaluate the CNN+LSTM model using the prepared frame sequences.

## âœ… Work Completed

*. Dataset collection and preprocessing
*. Frame extraction and organization
*. Data pipeline design for sequence generation
*. Model architecture planning (CNN + LSTM)

## ðŸ”œ Next Step

*. Implement and train the CNN+LSTM model on the prepared dataset.
*. Evaluate model performance and fine-tune accuracy.
I have included the dataset files
