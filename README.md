# Safety-AI
AI Based Community Safety System Itâ€™s a system that uses artificial intelligence + sensors + data analysis to improve safety in a community (like a college campus, hostel, residential area, or city).


# The AI can:

        * Detect unusual or unsafe activities (fights, theft, accidents).

        * Recognize emergencies (fire, smoke, intrusion).

        * Analyze text/audio complaints from people (NLP).

        * Send alerts to security/authorities in real-time.


# Possible Features for Your Project:


## 1.Surveillance & Anomaly Detection (Computer Vision)

(1). AI model on CCTV feed to detect violence, trespassing, weapons, or accidents.


(2). Tools: OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, YOLO/Detectron2.


(3). Smart Emergency Alert (NLP + IoT)


(4). Residents can report incidents via a mobile app or chatbot.


(5). AI processes the message (NLP) and categorizes it as fire, theft, medical emergency, etc.


(6). Automatically alerts authorities.


## Predictive Crime/Incident Analysis (ML on historical data)

(1). Analyze past incidents to predict risky areas/times.


(2). Helps allocate security more efficiently.


(3). IoT Integration for Safety


(4). Connect AI with sensors (smoke, motion, sound).

      Example: If unusual noise is detected at night, AI checks CCTV and alerts guards.
